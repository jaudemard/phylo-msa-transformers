# Phylogenetically Informed MSA-Transformers

This project aim to rethink MSA-transformer, to include phylogenetic information in its process.

We selected representative taxa of mammals phylogeny, and computed multiple sequences alignment (MSA) from human sequences, including those species related proteins (minimum 50% identity).
